# Instructions
## Customization
The user can draw walls with their mouse, change pathfinding algorithms using the drop-down menu and change the way the path is visualized using the checkboxes on the left.
### Check boxes
The Diagonal check box changes whether the path is allowed to move diagonally or not

The Live Path Update check box changed whether the current path can be seen while the program is running

The Real-Time check box changes whether the program is shown running in real-time or just computed (This effects the maze generation and path generation)

## General Rules
After every run, before trying to change the algorithm, draw walls, or run again, either the Reset, RanPos (random position), Maze, Random, or Grid buttons need to be clicked.
### Reset Buttons
The Reset button removes all the walls

The RanPos button changes the position of the start and end point randomly

The Maze button generates a maze

The Random button creates a random set of walls

The Grid button changed the grid length and width to the number on its left
